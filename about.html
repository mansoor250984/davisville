        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2007 as Eyedentity Eyestyles, our clinic was the neighbourhood optical boutique in the historic Mount Pleasant Davisville Village. The optician and owner, Ada, has been in the industry for over 10 years. Friendly and passionate about what she does, Ada has the eye for style and comfort to fit every individual's needs. She will fit you with the perfect frame that expresses your "eyedentity".</p>

    </div>
    <div class="row padT7 row2">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>Seeking to offer her clients comprehensive care, Ada formed a partnership with Dr. Brenda Li and associates. As a result of this collaboration, Davisville Eye Care was formed. As we outgrew our space and expanded our services over the past 7 years, we have moved twice within the Davisville neighbourhood to better serve our patients. Our new clinic will be opening its doors in 2021 - come pop by for a visit!</p>
