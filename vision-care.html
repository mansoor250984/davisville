        <h2>Ocular Disease Management</h2>
        <p>From cataracts and diabetic retinopathy to dry eye syndrome and glaucoma, rely on our doctors to treat, co-manage and provide routine monitoring to help maintain your vision for the long-term.</p>
        <div class="accordion-collapsible">
          <h3 class="collapsible">COMMON CONDITIONS </h3>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Conditions include AMD, glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, dry eye syndrome and eye allergies.</p>
            <p>Diabetes is a disease where your body cannot properly digest sugars. There are two types of diabetes (Type I and Type II) and both forms can lead to diabetic retinopathy, a disease that can severely damage the retina resulting in permanent vision loss. Diabetic retinopathy is a serious condition that needs to be regularly monitored by an optometrist and annual eye exams for this condition are covered by OHIP once a year regardless of age.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="collapsible">WHAT TO BRING WITH YOU</h3>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Bring your eyeglasses, contact lenses boxes, and OHIP card. Sunglasses are also recommended because the eye drops used during the eye exam make patients more sensitive to light for approximately 2-4 hours after the appointment and more difficult to focus up close.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="collapsible">WHAT WE'LL DO</h3>
           <div class="content">
            <p>A dilated fundus exam is where drops are used to enlarge the pupil size of the patient in order to obtain a better view of the retina and the back of the eye. This type of exam is important as it is an effective method to evaluate the posterior eye.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="collapsible">APPOINTMENT COSTS</h3>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Our comprehensive eye exams include glasses prescription check, dilated fundus exam, retinal photography. Additional testing also available and would be recommended by the Optometrist at your exam if necessary. Please call our office to inquire.</p>

        <p>Your vision is priceless. Many serious eye conditions don’t have obvious symptoms. Some eye diseases only show symptoms when the condition is advanced and difficult, or even impossible, to treat. A comprehensive eye exam provides the full assurance of vision and eye health that a store sight test or a school vision screening cannot.</p>
       </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6"><p>At Davisville Eye Care, we evaluate many factors that can affect your vision and eye health. We review your case history, conduct an external and internal exam of your eyes, and measure vision qualities, such as eye movements and coordination , sharpness of vision and peripheral vision. We also evaluate your ability to adjust focus, and to see colour and depth normally.</p></div>
