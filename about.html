        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2007 as Eyedentity Eyestyles, our clinic was the neighbourhood optical boutique in the historic Mount Pleasant Davisville Village. The optician and owner, Ada, has been in the industry for over 10 years. Friendly and passionate about what she does, Ada has the eye for style and comfort to fit every individual's needs. She will fit you with the perfect frame that expresses your "eyedentity".</p>

    </div>
    <div class="row padT7 row2">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>Seeking to offer her clients comprehensive care, Ada formed a partnership with Dr. Brenda Li and associates. As a result of this collaboration, Davisville Eye Care was formed. As we outgrew our space and expanded our services over the past 7 years, we have moved twice within the Davisville neighbourhood to better serve our patients. Our new clinic will be opening its doors in 2021 - come pop by for a visit!</p>

A sight test on the other hand is only the measurement for an eye glass prescription performed by an Optician often using automated instruments. In this case, eye health is not being examined and many silent sight threatening diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration are not being detected.</div>

              <div class="card-body">Inside the eyeball there is a clear lens that provides the power to help us focus. As we age, the lens becomes cloudy due to UV absorption and environmental factors. In the early stages of cataract development, changes in glasses prescription can solve the focussing issue. As the cataract matures, surgery can be performed by an Ophthalmologist to remove the cloudy lens and replacing it with a clear artificial lens. Cataracts can occur at any age, however typically it is found in patients over the age of 65.</div>

There are many risk factors for developing glaucoma such as age, race and family history. Your optometrist will screen for glaucoma at every routine eye exam.</div>

There is currently no treatment to stop macular degeneration. Once macular degeneration is diagnosed we can take certain measures to help prevent the progression of the disease. Macular degeneration is one of the leading causes of vision loss in patients over the age of 65. This disease can also be hereditary. It is important to have an Optometrist to detect for early signs of this disease.</div>

        <p>Dr. Sin was born and raised in Toronto and no stranger to the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood. If she looks familiar, that’s because she used to work as a front desk staff member at Davisville Eye Care! The clinic opened her eyes and sparked her interest in Optometry. Now she is happy to be back and excited to accept new patients and work with them to deliver the best eye care solution that’s right for them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sin graduated from Queen’s University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and received her Doctor of Optometry degree from the Illinois College of Optometry in Chicago, Illinois. She is an associate of the Optometric Extension Program Foundation and is currently working through the clinical curriculum to enhance her training in Vision Therapy. She is a current member of the College of Optometrists of Ontario, Ontario Association of Optometrists and Canadian Association of Optometrists.</p>
        <p>Her clinical interests include Pediatrics, Ocular Disease and Vision Therapy. When not in the office, Dr. Sin enjoys running, practicing yoga, and spending time with her family. She also loves baking – ask her about her banana bread recipe!</p>
